# **Cardiovascular Risk Prediction **
I started this as a practice project.This is machine learning project and aim is to predict risk of getting cardivascular disease.The dataset is imported from kaggle platform.



## Data Summary

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.
